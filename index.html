    <h1>What is ANIMATION?</h1>
    <div class="what is animation__wrapper">
      <div class="what is animation__card">
        <p>Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.An animated cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style. The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human protagonists (either children or adults). Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds), the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that would be lethal in real life.
          The illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and/or beta movement, but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain. The illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other, with unnoticeable interruptions, is a stroboscopic effect. While animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background, computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment.
          Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. Television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally. For display on computers, technology such as the animated GIF and Flash animation were developed.
         In addition to short films, feature films, television series, animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in video games, motion graphics, user interfaces, and visual effects.[1]
          The physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata. Electronic automata were popularized by Disney as animatronics.

        <h1>Different style of ANIMATION</h1>
        <p>1.2D Vector Animation</p>
        <p> - This is one of the most common styles used for marketing videos. Images are created using computer software that uses vectors to easily animate shapes. Images can be modified and moved with the software automatically interpolating and updating the animation.
        It’s an animation style that produces smooth, crisp and dynamic 2D visuals. It’s particularly good for simple storytelling animations and anything where you’re looking for a quick and accessible way to communicate an idea.
        Along with its versatility, a major benefit of 2D vector animation is its cost-effectiveness. It’s a much more streamlined process than 3D animations – offering a fast and simple way to quickly turn concepts into videos that get results.
        </p>
        <p>2.Hand-Drawn Animation</p>
        <p> - This is the traditional way that animations were created – before digital tools changed everything. It’s that classic hand-drawn look of the old Disney movies with each animated element being drawn by an artist.
        It’s a personal touch that can add a warmth and character to the visuals that’s hard to recreate digitally. It’s especially good at anything character-based and for videos aiming to build empathy and engagement.
        The hand-drawn nature of traditional animation has made it a slow and costly option in the past. Technology has helped to reduce this issue with digital tools being used for tasks such as colouring to recreate the same feel with a much faster process.</p>
        <p>3.3D Animation</p>
        <p> - Also known as GGI (Computer Generated Imagery), this has replaced traditional hand-drawn animation as the most common format for animated movies. It’s similar to 2D vector animation but instead of a flat image, you are using 3D objects – characters, props and locations.
        Once these have been digitally created, animations can be quickly created with software interpolating the movements between each frame. The most common style it’s associated with is that of Pixar movies such as Toy Story and The Incredibles.
        But as techniques and technology advances, 3D animation is now able to handle virtually any kind of look or style. It’s particularly effective with any kind of informational or illustrative videos that show off products or designs.</p>
        <p>4.Motion Graphics</p>
        <p> - This is a kind of dynamic graphic design that uses shapes and text to tell a story or convey a message. Some of the earliest examples of this are seen with the work of Saul Bass in the 1960’s – creating the movie intro sequences for films like Psycho and West Side Story.
        With digital tools, it has become one of the most popular techniques with a flowing mix of text, charts and graphs combining to engage and entertain. It’s an ideal way to turn dry data into a visually stimulating film that communicates your core message.
        The use of dynamic text, fonts and simple shapes makes it a relatively low-cost technique but one that’s able to achieve a lot with little. Smart use of music and narration that are in sync with the visuals can make something that gets noticed.</p>
        <p>5. Rotoscope Animation</p>
        <p> - This technique was developed in the early days of animation. It works by tracing human movements from film images to create naturalistic animations. This is how the flowing movements of the character’s in Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was achieved in 1937.
        It was also used to create the distinctive look of the 2006 sci-fi movie, A Scanner Darkly. It’s a technique that still packs a visual punch, capturing the kind of realistic movements that would take weeks to create from scratch.
        Digital tools can now automate the ‘tracing’ process with movements from video footage automatically tacked and turned into animations. Using this method, 2D sequences can be created that look as if they are in a 3D world.</p>
        <p>6. Cut-out Animation</p>
        <p> - South Park is probably the most notable example of this method. Trey Parker and Matt Stone created the pilot episode by cutting out paper shapes to create the characters and backdrops which they animated using a stop-motion camera.
        It’s a style that was used for many children’s shows, creating the feel of a storybook that has come to life. But while South Park has retained the same look, it’s no longer made with paper, scissors and patience – it’s all digitally created.
        By creating a digital version of the paper cutouts, it creates a fast and effective way to create characterful animations. It’s a technique that’s often seen in explainer videos and narrative-based marketing videos which require simple character animations.</p>
        <p>7. Live-Animated</p>
        <p> - This integrates digital images with real-world footage. This could be adding a floating label to an object or using animated arrows and markers to help explain what’s being seen in real-world footage. It’s a technique made simpler by the motion tracking abilities of modern video editing software.
        It means on-screen images can be tagged with graphical elements – as the camera moves, so do the attached graphic elements. By removing the need to painstakingly track the movements, it unlocks a whole range of creative techniques that can be used.
        With effective use, digital and real-world elements can work perfectly together. Embedding the information into a real-world setting can bring infographic data to life or help to visually explain how a product works.
       <p>8. Pinscreen Animation</p>
        <p> - This was a kind of predecessor to computer graphics. The method was created by French animator Alexandre Alexeïeff in the 1930s, using a board containing thousands of metal pins to create his distinctive animations.
        By embedding objects, the displaced pins recreate its image – much like the pixels of a computer monitor. Together with his assistant, Claire Parker, he used this method to create mesmerising and otherworldly animations.
        Until recently, it has remained a rather niche technique but it’s one that’s being rediscovered thanks to digital methods. One particularly innovative use is with large digitally controlled pinscreen displays used at shows and events.</p>
        <p>9. Screencast Animation</p>
        <p> - Sometimes the simplest methods are the most effective. Screencast animations are a good example of this. It’s a way to turn screen captures into fun, engaging and informative videos.
        The main use of this is to show how software UI works with captures of software or services being used. These can be packaged with overlays and narration to explain what’s happening and to create a more engaging experience than simply watching a screen.
        It’s a ‘show, don’t tell’ approach that’s ideal for demonstrating digital services. Being able to see something in use can have a powerful impact on conversion rates and it’s ideal for any kind of informational or tutorial needs.</p>
        <p>10. Typography Animation</p>
        <p> - Also known as kinetic animation, this is a technique that brings words to life. It uses the animation and movement of text with visual effects. It’s a style that has the power to enhance the written or spoken word.
        A variety of techniques can be used but it’s most commonly done as 2D vector animation. It’s a technique that’s often used to communicate statistical data or survey findings. It’s also used as a visual way to focus on inspirational or emotional recorded speech.
        It’s a simple, accessible and cost-effective technique but requires a skilled animator to find ways to turn text into something visually stimulating. It’s a format that can create impactful results.</p>
        <p>11. Mechanical Animation</p>
        <p> - Mechanical animation will typically show how something works. It does this with a 3D visual representation of a product, device or service. It can delve inside the mechanisms, stripping away any visual clutter to clearly show what’s going on.
        The obvious use case is to demonstrate technical products and services. It’s a way to quickly explain how engineering solutions enhance performance or to tackle a problem. It can convey complex technical information in a matter of seconds.
        With voice-over and music, a drab technical presentation can be turned into a vibrant experience. Alongside promotion, it’s also ideal for any kind of training or informational films that need to share knowledge on how something works.</p>
        <p>12. Whiteboard animation</p>
        <p> - In 2007, global shipping company UPS launched a series of videos that explained their services via a presenter doodling images on a whiteboard. It was a simple and effective format that inspired a new genre of whiteboard animations.
        While the originals were of a person drawing on a board, most of those that followed achieved the same look and feel with a digital process. It’s a style that’s particularly suited to explainer videos – using simple images to convey complex information.
        It’s a style that has been the victim of its own success. Whiteboard animations, also known as doodle videos, became so common that they risked becoming something of a visual cliche. But the popularity is based on the fact that work. If you want a simple and effective way to convey information – they remain a powerful tool.</p>
        <p>13. Stop Motion Animation
        <p> - This is a technique that can turn any real-world object into an animation. It’s the way that classic children’s TV shows such as The Clangers and Magic Roundabout were made with puppets repeatedly moved and photographed using stop-motion.
        While digital processes have created faster ways to animate objects, stop motion has survived. This is partly because of the special ‘feel’ that’s captured by the process. It has a tactile and homespun quality that’s hard to recreate digitally.
        Another strength is its accessibility and versatility. It can be used to create characters and narratives or to bring real-world products to life. The simplicity encourages creativity and exploring innovative ways to bring static objects to life.</p> 
        <p>14. Augmented Reality Animation</p>
        <p> - This animation technique blends digital images with live real-world footage. An example of this is the live filter used by a service such as Snapchat, letting users view themselves as a pirate or try out virtual hairstyles.
        This same idea can be used for anything that allows the digital world to connect to the real world – whether it’s a mobile phone, tablet device or VR headset. An example would be bringing a product life with animations triggered when a label or logo is viewed through a camera phone.
        It’s still a fairly new technology but augmented reality animation has already established itself as a format within children’s books, allowing story characters to literally jump out from the page.</p>
        <p>15. Retro Animation</p>
        <p> - Retro animations look to tune into the nostalgic power of animations from yesteryear. It could be the heavily pixelated look of old arcade games or recreating the style of a popular children’s television show.
        It’s an approach that can be particularly effective when a specific demographic is being targeted. It’s a way to connect to people using a visual style that they have an affection for.
        While a retro animation can pack a nostalgic punch, the simple styles are something that digital tools can easily recreate. Hit the right note and you can harness the power of an affectionate blast from the past.</p>
        <p>16. Isometric Animation</p>
        <p> - This is a style that’s familiar from the world of video gamers with 2D images used to create the impression of a 3D world. It creates a distinctive look – a neat, clean look that can make complex things easier to understand.
        It’s often used in explainer and informational videos and the sense of depth that isometric design adds makes it particularly effective for anything involving maps or building layouts. The neatness of the style also helps to convey efficiency and order.
        It offers something of a best of both worlds solution – the visual engagement of a 3D world but without the costs. The benefits have to be balanced against the limitations of a fixed perspective.</p>
        <p>17. FlipBook Animation</p>
        <p> - It’s an endearingly simple way to communicate. This is just about as basic as animation gets with illustrations being hand-drawn onto the pages of a flipbook.
        Each image is updated slightly to create a flowing animation when the pages of the book are rapidly flicked through. Flipbooks are typically no longer than around 15 seconds but it’s a limitation that makes them ideal for short-form social media sites such as TikTok.  
        It’s a style that delivers a personal touch, something that can stand out in a world of swish graphics and dazzling marketing visuals. It’s also a cost-effective approach – the only requirements being a pencil, paper and an animator.</p>
        <p>18. Claymation Animation</p>
        <p> - Claymation animation creates characters and worlds using plasticine clay. The stop-motion method is used to film incremental changes in the positioning of the models to create the movement. It’s the technique used for all of the early Aardman Animations films.
        And despite digital animated models now providing a much simpler alternative, claymation is still going strong. This is thanks to the feeling that comes from objects moulded by human hands. It’s the slight imperfections – the occasional wobbliness and fingerprints on the clay models.
        It’s a format that can work for a young target audience and for anything that sets out to create a warm and comforting feel. With improvements to digital modelling, the claymation ‘feel’ can now be created digitally.</p>
        <p>19. Minimalist Animation</p>
        <p> - People are drawn to simplicity and clarity – something that’s not bombarding them. It’s delivering this fuss-free and zen-like experience that minimalist animations are designed to deliver.
        It’s an approach that aims to remove any visual clutter and provide only the images and animations needed to communicate your message. It’s an approach that suits products and services that aim to achieve similar goals – digital apps and services that make things simple.
        While clean visuals make it technically simple to make, the challenge comes in finding engaging and effective ways to say a lot with a little. It’s an approach that can help to hone your message – what’s important?</p>
        <p>20. 360 Animation</p>
        <p> - Instead of watching an animation, what if you could be inside it? This is the kind of thing that’s possible with 360 animations that take place in virtual reality worlds. It’s a technology that’s being pioneered by the gaming industry and the experiences designed for devices such as the Oculus Rift.
        It unlocks a new form of ‘metaverse’ where anything is possible – animated characters and avatars can exist in recreations of real-life locations with interactive objects floating around. But it’s just as effective for something simple, such as letting people tour a building or facility that’s not yet been built.
        It can be used for training and instructional purposes or to create the kind of special experiences that are delivered by making animated worlds and spaces that people can become a part of.</p>

       <p>1. Ibong Adarna (1997)</p>
       <p> Based on the famous local epic about a mythical bird and the three princes, this local animated movie featured the voices of famous actors and singers. These included Regine Velasquez, Martin Nievera, Boots Anson Roa, Marvin Agustin, and Jolina Magdangal (who gave voice to the magical bird). Gerry Garcia, the pioneer of Pinoy animation, was the writer and the director of the film.
       Awarded as the first full-length Pinoy animated film, Adarna adapted the story of the eponymous folklore and turned it into cartoon. It took animators plenty of time to finish voice recordings, drawings, and storyboards as part of the cel animation technique. There wasn’t enough money to produce an animation, too, during Adarna’s release; so the producers had a hard time financing the entire production of the film.</p>
       
       <p>2. Urduja (2008)</p>
       <p>3d animation school: urduja
       This 100-minute film showed the life and struggles of Princess Urduja, a warrior princess in Pangasinan. Actors Regine Velasquez, Cesar Montano, Eddie Garcia, Johnny Delgado, and Jay Manalo formed the cast giving voices to the lead characters.
       In the story, Princess Urduja is the only daughter of Tawilisi tribe’s chieftain, Lakanpati. He wants her to marry Simakwel, someone she dislikes. Instead, Urduja falls in love with Limhang, a stranger who escapes from the wrath of Wang and hides in Tawilisi’s place. Limhang’s kindness and good deeds won the tribe’s trust and respect. The tribe bravely fought against Wang.
       Urduja is a product of teamwork among a group of Filipino animators, who used the traditional animation process of hand drawing.</p>
       
       <p>3. Dayo: Sa Mundo ng Elementalia (2008)</p>
       <p>This movie showed the adventure of an 11-year-old boy as he attempted to rescue his kidnapped grandparents. His quest led him to a magical land called Elementalia, which housed popular local creatures of mythology, such as kapre, aswang, and tikbalang. Dayo starred voice actors Nash Aguas, Michael V., Peque Gallaga, and Trina Legaspi.A mix of traditional and 3D animations, the film became the country’s first all-digital full-length animated feature. Over 500 animators worked on the 2D animation of the characters and the 3D animation of the scene’s backdrops.</p>
       
       <p>4. RPG Metanoia (2010)</p>
       <p>RPG Metanoia shares the story of a timid young online gaming fan named Nico.

        RPG became the first full-length 3D animated film in the Philippines.</p>
       
       <p>5. Saving Sally (2016)</p>
       <p>A story of teenage love between a young aspiring comic book artist and a gadget inventor, Saving Sally depicts a Manila-state of mind in Marty’s world. In here, huge animated monsters roam the streets of Manila while tackling the characters’ yearnings and the country’s current rampant issues. Enzo Marcos gave life to Marty’s role while Rhian Ramos played Sally.
       Behind the nice story and visuals of Saving Sally hides the entire staff and cast’s struggles. It is perhaps the toughest in the list because the film took a decade before it finally reached the cinemas. It ran out of funds, faced problems with the initial casting, and endured arduous editing works. But it’s worth the long wait! What makes Saving Sally a great artwork is it mixes 2D animation with live actors.</p>

           <h1>History of Animation<h1>
         <p>Before cinematography</p>	
         <p> - Hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation, people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry, automata, shadow play, and the magic lantern. The multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in European theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion.A projecting praxinoscope, from 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene.In 1833, the stroboscopic disc (better known as the phénakisticope) introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures. Series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years, but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements. The stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope (1866), the flip book (1868) and the praxinoscope (1877). A typical 19th-century animation contained about 12 images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually. The flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end, but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds. The first to create much longer sequences seems to have been Charles-Émile Reynaud, who between 1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10- to 15-minute-long Pantomimes Lumineuses.</p>
         
         <p>Silent era</p>
         <p> - When cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades, the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. Animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys, with chromolithography film loops (often traced from live-action footage) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home. It would take some more years before animation reached movie theaters.After earlier experiments by movie pioneers J. Stuart Blackton, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper, Segundo de Chomón, and Edwin S. Porter (among others), Blackton's The Haunted Hotel (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail, without signs of any known stage trick.Émile Cohl's Fantasmagorie (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional (hand-drawn) animation. Other great artistic and very influential short films were created by Ladislas Starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by Winsor McCay with detailed drawn animation in films such as Little Nemo (1911) and Gertie the Dinosaur (1914).During the 1910s, the production of animated "cartoons" became an industry in the US.Successful producer John Randolph Bray and animator Earl Hurd, patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.Felix the Cat, who debuted in 1919, became the first animated superstar.</p>
         
         <p>American golden age</p>
         <p> - In 1928, Steamboat Willie, featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, popularized film with synchronized sound and put Walt Disney's studio at the forefront of the animation industry.The enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of American animation that would last until the 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers, including Walt Disney Productions' Goofy (1932) and Donald Duck (1934), Warner Bros. Cartoons' Looney Tunes characters like Porky Pig (1935), Daffy Duck (1937), Bugs Bunny (1938–1940), Tweety (1941–1942), Sylvester the Cat (1945), Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner (1949), Fleischer Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios' Betty Boop (1930), Popeye (1933), Superman (1941) and Casper (1945), MGM cartoon studio's Tom and Jerry (1940) and Droopy, Walter Lantz Productions/Universal Studio Cartoons' Woody Woodpecker (1940), Terrytoons/20th Century Fox's Dinky Duck (1939), Mighty Mouse (1942) and Heckle and Jeckle (1946) and United Artists' Pink Panther (1963).</p>
         
         <p>Features before CGI</p>
         <p> - Italian-Argentine cartoonist Quirino Cristiani showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character El Peludo (based on President Yrigoyen) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film El Apóstol.In 1917, Italian-Argentine director Quirino Cristiani made the first feature-length film El Apóstol (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's Sin dejar rastros in 1918, but one day after its premiere, the film was confiscated by the government.After working on it for three years, Lotte Reiniger released the German feature-length silhouette animation Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.In 1937, Walt Disney Studios premiered their first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features as of May 2020.[7][8] The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with Gulliver's Travels with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941–1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterward, Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until Ralph Bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with An American Tail in 1986.Although relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques. Russia's Soyuzmultfilm animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018. China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France, and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation.</p>
         
         <p>Television</p>
         <p> - Animation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most developed countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching Saturday-morning cartoons. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. Hanna-Barbera Productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as The Flintstones (1960–1966) (the first prime time animated series), Scooby-Doo (since 1969) and Belgian co-production The Smurfs (1981–1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as The Simpsons (since 1989) as part of a "renaissance" of American animation.While US animated series also spawned successes internationally, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation. Japanese anime TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, resulting in hit series such as Barbapapa (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973–1977), Wickie und die starken Männer/小さなバイキング ビッケ (Vicky the Viking) (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974), and The Jungle Book (Italy/Japapan 1989).</p>
         
         <p>Switch from cels to computers</p>
         <p> - Computer animation was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller Futureworld (1976).The Rescuers Down Under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.[9] It was produced in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation on the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), developed by The Walt Disney Company in collaboration with Pixar in the late 1980s.The so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's Toy Story (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.Most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance, in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.</p>
